# Vision Transformer (ViT) Animal Image Classifier

# Project Overview
This project presents an advanced image classification solution leveraging the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. Our goal is to accurately identify and categorize various animal species from a specific dataset, showcasing the powerful capabilities of transformers in computer vision tasks. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks, the ViT processes images by treating them as sequences of visual "words" (patches), enabling it to capture global contextual information and long-range dependencies, which is crucial for distinguishing between diverse animal classes.

# Dataset
This classifier is trained and evaluated on a custom animal kingdom dataset. This comprehensive collection comprises approximately 3400 images distributed across 13 distinct animal categories, including lions, tigers, etc...
